# Server Application Documentation

## How to Run the Server Application
To execute the server application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Navigate to the `server` directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
3. Execute the start_development.sh script:
   ```bash
   ./start_development.sh
   ```
    This script will create and start a container, and it will provide you with a shell inside the container environment.
    Note: If you prefer, you can customize the application before starting it by making necessary changes. To start the application without customization, simply run go run cmd/grpc/main.go
